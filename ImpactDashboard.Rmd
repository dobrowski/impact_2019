Page 1: State Accountability Data
============================================

Column {data-width=150}
-------------------------------------

The graphs on this page display some of the ways in which we have tried to compile accountability data into new ways to look at it. The following tabs present other areas of work. 

The first graph calculated which schools in Monterey County were eligble for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) under ESSA, prior to CDE releasing a list of eligible schools.  It is intended to convey which schools are eligible and the criteria qualifying their eligibility -- either Dashboard Indicators or Graduation rate.

The second graph was used to show the changes over two years in the percent of students meeting or exceeding standards on Math CAASPP testing.  Red shows the percentage in 2015-16, Orange shows the percentage in 2016-17, and Blue shows the percentage in 2017-18.  It is ordered by district from those making the most improvement from 2015-16 to 2017-18 to those making the least. 

The third graph was used to show Chronic Absenteeism rates by subgroup and by school. The darker areas show higher levels of chronic absenteeism.  The viewer can quickly identify patterns across subgroups or schools and can also see specific rates as they are interested.

Page 2: Core Dashboard
============================================


Column {data-width=100}
-------------------------------------

The establishment and roll-out of the CORE Dashboard was a significant undertaking.  There are currently 16 districts with signed joinders.  The majority of them have data uploaded into CORE and growth measures calculated.  In addition to trainings done at the Instructional Leaders Network, in person trainings for principals, academic coachs and other district leaders have been provided for Salinas City Elementary School District and Carmel Unified School District.

Page 3: Mapping Indicators
============================================


Column {data-width=100}
-------------------------------------

Maps have been created to visually display information in a way that can highlight disparities and to which viewers can better relate.  In additions the maps are interactive and the viewer and zoom into areas they are most interested in.

The first map shows ELA, Math, Chronic Absenteeism and Suspensions for feeder schools into Salinas Union High School District.  The colors show the gradation on the percentage of students who meet or exceed standards on ELA.  

The second map shows the estimated life expectancy at birth for census tracts in the United States for 2010-2015. In Monterey County, Downtown Salinas has the shortest estimate at 73.3.  Downtown Monterey has the longest at 86.7.

Almost any data source that is associated with a zip code, census tract, school or district can be mapped moving forward.

Page 4: Exploratory Data - Twitter
==============================


Column {data-width=100}
-------------------------------------

This page displays some exploratory data work.  In this case looking at Twitter data.  

The first graph displays the most commonly used words by user since the start of 2019.  

The second graph is an interactive network analysis looking at the connection between users.  In this particular case it shows any tweets from the past week that use the word "MCOE" and then displays who is retweeting whom.  The arrow points from who is retweeting to the original tweeter.  The size of the nodes and thickness of the lines indicate higher levels of retweets.  The viewer can zoom in, rearrange the layout, and select or hover over individuals of interest to see their connections.
